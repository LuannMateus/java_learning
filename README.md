<h2>What is Java ⁉️</h3>

<blockquote>
<strong>Java</strong>  is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed for developing programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, but later became a popular choice for creating web applications. The  <strong>Java</strong> syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented programming language.
